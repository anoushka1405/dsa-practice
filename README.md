# 🧠 DSA Practice Tracker

Welcome to my DSA practice journal — a repository to document my consistent progress in Data Structures & Algorithms.

---

## 🎯 Goals

-  Solve 150–200 LeetCode problems by October 2025
-  Strengthen core DSA topics like Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, DP, and Graphs
-  Build intuition and pattern recognition through consistent daily practice
-  Prepare for coding interviews
