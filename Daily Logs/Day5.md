# Day 5 – July 23, 2025

---

## Doubly Linked List (Revision)

- Revised core operations in DLL:
  - Inserting at the head
  - Removing from the tail
  - Deleting a given node
  - Reversing a doubly linked list
- Understood edge case handling 

---

##  Hashing & Maps

- Revised the concept of **hashing** and its real-world applications.
- Practiced and understood internal workings of:
  - `unordered_map` (hash-based)
  - `map` (tree-based, sorted)
- Learned when to choose one over the other based on constraints and time complexity.

---

## Bit Manipulation (Theory Revision)

- Reviewed core concepts:
  - Checking if a number is odd/even using `n & 1`
  - Setting, clearing, and toggling bits using bitwise operations
- Understood performance advantages of using bitwise operators in competitive programming.

---

## Subarray with Maximum Length (Sum = K)

- Revisited the problem of finding the maximum length subarray with a given sum (positive & negative integers).
- Used **prefix sum with hashmap** to track earliest index of a given prefix sum.
- Understood how hashing optimizes from O(n²) to O(n) time.

---

##  Challenges Faced

- Needed extra care in pointer adjustments while reversing DLL.
- Initially confused prefix sum vs actual subarray sums during revision.

---

##  Insights

- Revisiting core concepts repeatedly strengthens confidence in implementation and edge case handling.
