### Day 6 – July 24, 2025

#### Linked List – Add Two Numbers (Leetcode 2)
- Studied the optimal digit-wise addition approach with carry handling.
- Understood traversal of two linked lists in parallel and creating a result list using a dummy node.
- Focused on understanding rather than implementing today.

#### Hashing & Prefix Sum
- **Two Sum**:
  - Implemented using hash map to store complement values.
  - Strengthened understanding of `unordered_map` efficiency 
- **Leetcode 560 – Subarray Sum Equals K**:
  - Deepened understanding of prefix sum + hashmap technique.
  - Tracked frequency of prefix sums to count valid subarrays.
  - Reinforced how hashmap optimization brings down time complexity from O(n²) to O(n).

#### Stacks – Revision
- Revised core stack operations and implementations:
  - Push, pop, top, isEmpty.
  - Implemented stack using arrays and Linked List.

#### Challenges Faced
- Needed repeated walkthroughs to internalize prefix sum + map logic in LC 560.
- Understanding edge cases in stack usage and debugging off-by-one errors.

#### Insights
- Prefix sum with hashmap is a key pattern in many medium-level problems.
