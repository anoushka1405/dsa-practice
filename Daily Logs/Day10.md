### Day 10 â€“ August 1, 2025

#### Topics Covered

**Linked Lists:**

**Split a Circular Linked List into Two Equal Parts**  
- Wrote custom logic to split a circular linked list into two halves.
- Used slow and fast pointer technique to find the midpoint.
- If the list had an odd number of nodes, ensured the first list got the extra node.
- Carefully handled circular linking in both resulting halves.

**Check if Linked List is a Palindrome (LeetCode 234)**  
- Applied two-pointer (slow & fast) technique to find the midpoint.
- Reversed the second half of the list.
- Compared the first half with the reversed second half node by node.
- Restored the original structure of the list after comparison.

#### Insights
- Fast and slow pointers are versatile: they help find midpoints, detect loops, and more.
- In palindrome checks, restoring the original list is a good practice for clean code.
- Careful pointer handling is critical in circular linked lists to avoid infinite loops or broken references.

#### Challenges
- Needed careful dry runs to correctly split a circular list.
