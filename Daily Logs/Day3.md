### Day 3 - July 20, 2025

#### Topics Covered

**Stacks**  
- Concept of Stack Data Structure and its real time use cases such as undo/redo opration, browser history and function calls.
- Basics of Queue Data Structure.
- Implemetation of stacks through Arrays and Linked List.

**Bit Manipulation**  
- Understood `n & (1 << i)` to check if i-th bit is set  
- Revised left shift and right shift operators.
- Practiced:
  - Counting set bits (Brute force and Brian Kernighanâ€™s Algorithm)  

**Majority Element - Leetcode 169**  
- Solved via:
  - Brute force  
  - Hash map approach  
  - Mooreâ€™s Voting Algorithm (optimal)  
- Understood how frequency tracking works without explicit counting  

---

#### Challenges Faced
- Bitwise operations weren't intuitive initially  
- Faced difficulty in Mooreâ€™s logic and maintaining candidate count  

---

#### ðŸ’¡ Insights
- Many problems reuse fundamental algorithms like prefix sum, hash maps, and bitwise tricks  
- Brian Kernighanâ€™s bit count is optimal and elegant for set bit count  
- Mooreâ€™s Voting Algorithm is highly efficient for problems with a guaranteed majority
