#  Day 1 - July 18, 2025

##  Topics Covered

### Linked List
- [x] Reversing Double Linked List
- [x] Cycle Detection using Hashing (Brute Force)
- [x] Floyd’s Cycle Detection Algorithm (Tortoise & Hare)
  - Understood logic of `slow == fast` and finding cycle start (entry pointer)
  - Explored math behind distances: L1, L2, C

### Bit Manipulation
- [x] `1 << i` and checking the i-th bit using `(n & (1 << i))`
- [x] Signed vs Unsigned binary representation
  - Two’s complement system
  - MSB usage in negative numbers
  - 8-bit vs 6-bit representation
  - Relation between signed and unsigned
  - Overflow and wrapping
- [x] Check if given number is power of 2, Check odd and even numbers,Check if i'th bit is set or not. All using bit manipulation.

### Maps in C++
- Revisited basics, practiced implementation

### Prefix Sum / Hashing
-  Started thinking about “Longest Subarray with Given Sum K (Positives)”
-  Implemented Brute Force Approach

##  Challenges Faced
- Confused by Floyd’s math and `L1` (head to cycle start)
- Struggled with brute force logic for subarray sum problem
- Needed C++ map refresher

## 💡 Insights
- Cycle detection with two pointers is powerful
- Binary representation depends on interpretation
- Bit Manipulation is a very powerful technique to build optimised solutions.
